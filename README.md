# ðŸŒŸ Hello World! I'm Dan! ðŸŒŸ

Hey there, fellow developers, super-juniors looking to steal code, and people who got lost and found themselves in this place! Welcome to my coding journey. This repository is my little corner of chaos where I break things, vent about syntax, and plot world domination. Don't worry, I'm still learning the ropes, so there is plenty of time to doomsday prep. ðŸ˜„

- **Name**: Dan Palmer

## Projects

Here's a glimpse of my coding adventures:

1. [**Philosophers**](https://github.com/forbidden-arts/philosophers): A multi-threading trip down the rabbit hole that explores the metaphysical nature of existence by pitting philosophers head-to-head in a starvation-fueled Thunderdome!
2. [**Push Swap**](https://github.com/forbidden-arts/push_swap): Ever wanted to order a list but you only have two hands? This is exactly like that, but as a compensatory move, you can have infinite fingers and your hands can pivot.
3. [**MiniShell**](https://github.com/forbidden-arts/minishell): Let posterity show that this was the first step on the journey of my computer gaining sentience. Hopefully it remembers me fondly when it starts building terminators.

## Skills

- C, C++, JavaScript, Python... and holding conversations with myself - "for debugging".
- Creating bugs unintentionally and then squashing them like a pro.
- Spending hours on Stack Overflow trying to understand someone else's code.

## Fun Facts

- I believe that indentation is a form of art and should be treated accordingly.
- My code is powered by copious amounts of coffee and the occasional slice of pizza.
- I can type "console.log('Hello, World!');" faster than I can spell my own name.
